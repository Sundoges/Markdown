## 详细描述

### 有变化

- According to the survey, there has been a steady increase from (%) to (%) of (what事情) , while the percentage of ... has jumped markedly to ...

根据调查报告,  从 (\%) 到 (\%) 增长平稳，但是当(what事情)的时候比例惊人地到达了(%) 。

- Based upon the data given above, we can see that the unmber of (first item) has risen dramatically from (statistic) to (statistic) during (time spin), while the amout of (second item) jumped from (statistic) to (statistic) in the same time.

根据上面给出的数据，我么可以看到 (first item) 的数量在 (time spin) 之间惊人地从 (statistic) 增长到了 (statistic) ，同时 (second item) 的数量也从 (statistic) 增长到了 (statistic) 。

### 没有变化

- From the statistic given, we may draw the conclusion that the spending on New Years presents is highest among all the four categories, at approximately 40%.

根据给出的数据，我们可以得出结论：(something)的开支所占百分比在(number)种类中最高，大约为40%

- Whereas the amount (spent on) (transport, ……) accounts for about( 20%) (each/ total).
- Whereas the amount (prefer on) (transport, ……) accounts for about( 20%) (each/ total).

然而，(something) 的 (did on/in) 只有大约 (各自/总计) 占(percentage/ amout)

# 分析原因

- (Museums) hold (an attraction and fascination) for (most people), of all ages, from young children to the elderly, for at least (two) fundamental reasons.

(what) 对 (who)，包括 (frist kind) 到 (second kind) 所有 (kind of people) 有 (traits)的作用  

- The first reason many people are interested in (visiting the museum) is to (learn about the history and culture in a place).

第一个原因是很多人喜欢(doing what) is to (do what),  

- Another reason why (people) (visit museums) is that( they are not only for adults), but also (for the whole family a wonderful activity enjoyed by children as well as grandparents).

为什么 (who) (do something)的另一个原因是 (which)不只是 (something), 还是 (something)。  

# 分析利弊
  
- While (main theme) does have the potential negatively affect (one side) , it can also be good for (other side) .

虽然 (main theme) 对 (one side)会产生潜在的不利影响 , 但是它对 (other side) 也有一定的好处。  

> ## 可以直接使用在上句的词
>
> - 吸引力、魅力：attraction, charm, fascination, grace  
> - 讨厌：disgust, hate, aversion  
> - 生气：anger  
  
- It is obvious that (what) can adversely affect (what) because it drains their energy.

很明显 (main theme) 对 (what) 造成不利影响，因为(main theme)消耗了他们的精力.  
  
- ... can also be deterimental to ... by damaging their incentive to ...

(main theme) 也对 (other side) 有害，通过减少他们对 (主体) 的积极性。  

# 举例说明

- For one, it can help (who) better undertand their perferences or to test out a possible (what) direction.

举例来说，它可以帮助（who）更好的认识到他们的喜好或者探索出一个可行的（what）的方向。
  
# 分析原因的总结  

- In summarry, (people enjoy visiting museums) because doing so helps them to understand the history and ...

总的来说, (someone do something) 因为这么做帮助他们 (do something)。  
  
- Meanwhile, it is (an educational and cultural experience) that can (be enjoyed by the whole family).

同时,这件事情也是 (something)可以(do something).

# 分析利弊的总结
  
- Additionally, companies seeking to recruit fresh graduates will give preference to those who with (what) experience.  
另外, 企业 招聘 刚毕业的大学生，更倾向于 那些有 (what) 经验的人.  
  
- In the end, the impact of (main theme) depends on (whose) ability to maintain a balance between their (one side) and (main theme).
最后，(main theme) 的影响 取决于 (whose) 维持在 (one side) 和 (main theme) 之间平衡的能力。  
  
- If (students) are able to manage their time effectively and secure (academic performance as usual), (part time job) is certain to yield a positive impact.  
如果 (who) 能够 高效的管理 他们的时间  同时 保证 (what事情), (main theme)一定会产生积极的影响。
